title: Setup Testing
---

This is my test post, made by following Zach M's tutorial for Metis.

This is the start of a github blog about my experiences through Metis, and the funny things I come across as someone using WSL in a Cult of Apple.

Testing this out to see the wordwrap possibilities and other changes.
